## About

It fills me with immense pride and satisfaction to have the opportunity to share "raysonts" with all of you. Delving right into the heart of it, what we have here is a very fast and non-recursive dynamic renderer of external JSON sources fetched from URLs, ingeniously developed using React Vite + TypeScript. This tool stands out not only for its speed but also for its ability to efficiently manage and render nested parts of the data structure, offering you the flexibility to directly expand or collapse these sections as needed.

Adding to its utility, the application boasts a search system. This feature enables you to precisely locate the value of a specific key by inputting its complete path in the search field. However, the feature that arguably steals the spotlight is the application’s innovative functionality to convert objects into TypeScript interfaces. With the mere click of a button, these interfaces can be saved directly to your clipboard, streamlining your development process.

As we look forward, the journey with "raysonts" is far from over. We are actively exploring additional functionalities to enhance this tool further. For the time being, let’s embrace and make the most of the current version of "raysonts"!
